## Reflection

This is one of the first react applications I built. Of course, at the time, fetching the API was something new for me to master. Another challenge was the css design. I was inspired to use a design very close to the design of The Weather Channel's website. Using the free weatherstack API, I was only provided with a handful of data stats. I had to pick the stats I wanted while trying to match the design of The Weather Channel's website. For a simple application, I am pleased with the way it turned out. One of my favorite parts was working with and seeing the results of the CSS gradients.  <br />

This application is live (see address above), while working with Heroku hosting, I was perplexed as to why the application appeared broken when using https. After googling and reading the weatherstack documentation, I found the free Weatherstack API only was available on http. From this I learnt it always helps to keep a level head and think logically through the steps of action.  <br />




## Available Scripts
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about running tests for more information.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`


Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!<br />

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at<br /> any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.<br /><br />

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies<br /> (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over <br />them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the<br /> copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.<br /><br />

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and<br /> middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we<br /> understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when<br /> you are ready for it.<br /><br />
